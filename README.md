nucumber
========
This is a spike of nucumber, a gherkin publish/display tool for .NET.

Eventually, the nucumber class library will be separated out into a nuget package. 
The aim is that clients will be able to drop the package into their .NET web application that contains a /features directory, and get the documentation in these features available with the website when it is running.
